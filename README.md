The code available in my repository is a portfolio website I created to showcase my projects and development skills. The website includes an initial section with information about myself and my competencies, as well as a list of projects I have developed. Each project has its own card, with details about the project, screenshots, and a link to access it. There is also a contact section, with a form for visitors to send me a message directly from the website. Feel free to explore and check out some of my projects!
